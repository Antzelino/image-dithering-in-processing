Small program in Processing for image dithering

This is a small program in Processing for image dithering.
The amount of colours used depends on the X variable of the mouse's position.
* If the user clicks at the far left, the amount of colours is on its minimum
* ...and if it's the far right, the maximum.

There is an example image along with the code, to see the results. The program expects a 512x512 image.

When run, the left image is the input image and the right image is the dithered one.
